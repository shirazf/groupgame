     <title>the nature game</title>
     The game art was created by Suki and Shiraz. 
     <p>Suki made the plants, potion, and evil cartoon characters. Shiraz created the background, tree, character, and realistic animals.</p>
     <p>Sabrina coded the whole game and created the start screen.</p>
     <p>Shiraz and Suki collaborated to write the final poem. </p>
